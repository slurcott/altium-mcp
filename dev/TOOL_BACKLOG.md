# Tool backlog

The living list of what the toolset is missing or gets wrong. **Any session that
hits a problem adds an entry here**. That includes sessions doing design work that
only *use* the tools. The protocol is in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

Entry format: **ID. Title** (status, date found, found by). Then the evidence (what
actually happened, not a guess), and the fix (what would stop it happening again).
Status is one of `open`, `in progress`, `needs Altium`, `done <commit>`, or `wontfix <reason>`.

Evidence sources: `python dev/mine_history.py` (clusters, wedges, lint refusals from
the run archive), `~/.claude/skills/altium-script/GOTCHAS.md`, and the session itself.

## Open

**B1. Production commands raise modals instead of returning errors** (open, 2026-09-21, smoke test)
- Evidence: `Altium_API.pas` has 11 `ShowMessage` calls, `other_utils.pas` 6 and
  `schematic_utils.pas` 1. An unknown command shows a modal and writes **no**
  response, so the bridge waits 120 s and the call looks like a wedge. This
  happened in the 2026-09-21 smoke test.
- Fix: replace each with `WriteResponse(False, '', <msg>)`. Step 1 of
  `GENERIC_COMMANDS.md`.

**B2. `save_doc` — one save that knows each document kind's rules** (open, 2026-09-21, fixture scripts)
- Evidence: 10 of 77 fixture scripts were save retries (`savesym`→`savesym5`,
  `save`→`save4`). One restart lost unsaved work.
- Fix: `GENERIC_COMMANDS.md` §1.

**B3. `sch_query` and `netlist_query`** (open, 2026-09-21, fixture scripts)
- Evidence: the miner finds an 11-script netlist cluster and a component+pin query
  cluster. Together that is 31 of 77 fixture scripts.
- Fix: `GENERIC_COMMANDS.md` §2–3. The netlist is built from the saved file,
  not `DM_Compile`, which can serve a cached netlist.

**B4. `sch_edit` and `sch_place`** (open, 2026-09-21, fixture scripts)
- Evidence: the miner finds 8 edit/delete and 8 place/save scripts. `placepico`
  and `placeenc` used `.Location`, which left 17 parts invisible.
- Fix: `GENERIC_COMMANDS.md` §4–5.

**B5. Pin hot-end is wrong for mirrored parts** (needs Altium, 2026-09-21, audit)
- Evidence: the header of `dev/check_connectivity.pas`. It is the prime suspect for
  net labels landing one pin pitch off, which silently grounded three Pico pins.
- Fix: a bench experiment on one mirrored part (compare `Pin.Location` and
  `Orientation` before and after `Mirror`), then correct `GetPinHotEnd`. This
  blocks `sch_label_pins`.

**B6. `get_pcb_layer_stackup` uses `LayersInStackCount`** (needs Altium, 2026-09-21, audit)
- Evidence: `pcb_utils.pas:1076`. GOTCHAS says this name wedged the sandbox, and
  the linter denylists it.
- Fix: run the tool once on a PCB. If it wedges, replace it with a stack
  iteration. If it works, the GOTCHAS entry needs a note on the context in which
  the name failed.

**B7. The fixture session hand-wrote work that existing tools already do** (open, 2026-09-21, fixture scripts)
- Evidence: 7 footprint builders and 3 footprint dumps, which
  `create_footprints_batch` and `get_footprint_primitives` cover, and 3 symbol
  scripts. It probably ran without the MCP connected (`dev/run_sandbox.py` exists
  for exactly that case).
- Fix: confirm that the altium MCP is configured for the project directory
  the design sessions run in. Make `dev/run_sandbox.py --tools` print the
  command list, so a CLI-only session knows what exists.

**B8. Two sandboxes with different scratch-variable sets** (open, 2026-09-21, audit)
- Evidence: `dev/sandbox/Sandbox.pas` declares `S4-5, I4-5, Obj6-7, List2,
  TargetDoc, ...`, while `server/SandboxScript/Sandbox.pas` does not. The dev
  scripts wedge the server sandbox; the linter now catches this.
- Fix: give `dev/sandbox_runner.py` the same guard, lint and `USER VARS`
  injection, so dev scripts declare what they use and both sandboxes can
  share one variable set.

**B9. Bridge timeout is fixed at 120 s and marks a wedge** (open, 2026-09-21, design)
- Evidence: long legitimate commands (`run_output_jobs`, large batches) would
  be marked wedged.
- Fix: a timeout per command in `execute_command`, and a "slow, not wedged"
  check (is Altium's CPU busy? is a dialog up?) before marking.

**B10. Linter: names in `Run`/`SandboxLog` scope count as reserved** (open, 2026-09-21, design)
- Evidence: a user var named `Msg` is refused because it is `SandboxLog`'s parameter.
- Fix: this is harmless but over-strict. Only globals and `Run` locals should collide.

**B11. Post the upstream issue about `-REditScript:Stop`** (open, 2026-09-21, user)
- Evidence: the draft sits untracked at `ISSUE-DRAFT-editscript-stop.md` in the
  main checkout.
- Fix: post it. Mention that the class-only dialog filter also matches other
  applications' dialogs (fixed on `tool-hardening`).

## Done

- **D1.** Preflight, cross-session lock, wedge marker, and `altium_health` (74452d8).
- **D2.** Sandbox linter, `allow_new_api`, and `verified_api.txt` learning (74452d8).
- **D3.** Dialog dismissal limited to X2 windows; OK is pressed on single-button boxes (f8701b6).
- **D4.** Run archive and `dev/mine_history.py`.
